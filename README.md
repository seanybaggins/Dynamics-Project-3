# Dynamics Project 3
The purpose of project 3 was to determine the angular displacement of a half cylinder and a hockey puck system at any given point in time using Lagrangian dynamics. Enclosed in this project is the problem statement provided by my instructor, videos visually illustrating the hockey puck/half cylinder system, the Mathematica notebook and MATLAB code for our calculations and a PDF with our final submission to our instructor.
## Dependancies
First, MATLAB and Mathematica must be installed. If the user does not have MATLAB and/ or Mathematica all parts of the code are still viewable in the Final Submission to Instructor PDF.

Second, in order to view the videos depicting the motion of the disk/ cylinder system the user must download the files to their personal machine.
